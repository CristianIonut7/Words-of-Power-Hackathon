# Words-of-Power-Hackathon
BESTEM 2025 challenge powered by BEST Bucharest & Veridion

Developement of a backend AI game (a decision-making algorithm) for a competitive word game where, each round, the system provides a specific word and the player must respond with the most cost-effective counter-word from a predefined list. The goal was to maximize efficiency by selecting the lowest-cost word that could beat the systemâ€™s word, while minimizing penalties when no winning option was available.
